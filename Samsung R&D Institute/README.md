# Summary

I got the opportunity to give a test for a 2 month summer internship at Samsung R&D Institute, Banglore(SRIB) in Nov 2021. During the test, the interns were also given the chance to get the PPO(pre-placement offer) by clearing a DSA based test called Software Advanced Test(SWC Advanced Test) which was conducted internally by SRIB.

I was able to clear the intern test and later the SWC Adv. test as well. In this post, I've described my interview experience for the 2 month intern position and of the SWC advances test. At the end, I've also shared some resources and tips to prepare for these interviews.

## 2 Month Summer Internship

- **Profile**: MAGPIE Intern(SRIB have renamed their Software Intern to MAGPIE Intern ðŸ™‚)
- **Mode**: Online(WFH)
- **Stipend**: 50000 per month

### Coding Round

- **Date**: 17 November 2021
- **Platform**: CoCubes
- **# of problems**: 3
- **Duration**: 70 mins
- **Difficulty**: Similar to LeetCode Easy/Medium
- **Note**: From the GFG interview experience articles, I assumed that the platform will not allow to use STL(for C++). Although, as far as I remember, this was not the case and all standard libraries that are used in competitive programming were allowed.

#### Problem 1

I don't remember the exact question. But it was an array based problem. It's solution just required sorting the array and then traversing it once to do some processing.

#### Problem 2

This was based on Binary Tree. Every node had some integer value. For each node, you are required to find the sum of the value of all nodes that comes before this node in its inorder traversal.

This can easily be solved by one inorder traversal.

#### Problem 3

This was again based on Binary Tree. I don't remember the problem but it just required a simple DFS.

### Interview Round

- **Date**: 13 December 2021
- **Mode**: Virtual using Google Meet and some online text editor
- **Duration**: 60 min

The interview can be divided into 4 parts of introduction, project discussion, coding problem and general discussion.

#### Introduction

- I took 5 min to give my introduction.
- I've already memorized my introduction by this time as this is somethings which is asked in every interview. So, it's better to craft a crisp and informative intro of yours beforehand.
- This should include, along with the obvious information like your name, branch, college, course etc., your key skills and proof of work i.e., your projects. It would be nice if you have something that you can show like some app/website which is deployed. Otherwise, projects with well written README and screenshots are also good.

#### Project Discussion

- This took around 10 min.
- I brifely explained the 3 projects that I've mentioned in my resume. Interviewer asked me to explain any one project in depth. So, I chose the one which I thought displays my skills the best.
- I explained its working flow, the reason behind choosing the tech stack that was used to build it and answered some clarifying questions along the way. Interviewer was interested in knowing the reason behind building this project and how it's helpful to anyone. Also, he asked me about the challenges I faced during building this project.  

#### Coding Problem: Implementation of Dynamic Stack

- This took around 30 min.
- I was asked to implement a dynamic stack. It's a standard problem. I used resizing array to build this. A video solution can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70wePMJiH2c). Another(and easier to code) approach would be to use linked list to implement stack.

#### General Discussion

- After the interview grill was over, I was asked if I had any questions for the interviewer.
- I asked about his typical day at SRIB, the team and the domain & projects that he and his team works on.
